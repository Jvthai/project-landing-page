# project-landing-page

This project involved the replication of a landing page going off of soley an image that was provided through the Odin Project and a few references for color codes, fonts and font sizes. There was a lot of focus on flex box wich proved to be challenging but because I was forded to arrange so many elements in a way that was visually appealing, I feel as though I gained a lot of experience and skill in front-end development. Overall I'm quite satisfied with the finish project.
